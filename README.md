## VR-Virtual Reality
VR is a technology that is used to make person experience any ***Virtual Environment*** from anywhere.\
An artificial world that was created in a VR equipment to provide a real life experience to the user.\
Imagine if we wish to go to paris for Eiffel tower, but not everyone can afford expenses to travel. so by using VR we can experience the feel of visiting the eiffel tower just by staying at home.
## AR-Augmented Reality
AR technology is simply embedding or adding virtual or 3D objects into real world environments where we don't need any special devices like we use for VR it works as an application in our mobile, tablet or PC.\
let's say we opened our mobile camera in AR application along with the real objects that we see through camera we can also see some additional objects that aren't actually there and we can interact with them like playing games.
## MR-Mixed Reality
MR is just like AR but we need a device like VR divices and we can interact with the virtual objects ditectly not through our devices, just like ***Holograms***.
