# AR-VR
## XR-Extended Reality
- Virtual Reality
- Augmented Reality
- Mixed Reality
## VR-Virtual Reality
VR is a technology that is used to make person experience any ***Virtual Environment*** from anywhere.\
An artificial world that was created in a VR equipment to provide a real life experience to the user.\
Imagine if we wish to go to paris for Eiffel tower, but not everyone can afford expenses to travel. so by using VR we can experience the feel of visiting the eiffel tower just by staying at home.\
[Example: watch this video VR-Cricket iB Cricket](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8C9w9BlKQX4)
## AR-Augmented Reality
AR technology is simply embedding or adding virtual or 3D objects into real world environments where we don't need any special devices like we use for VR it works as an application in our mobile, tablet or PC.\
let's say we opened our mobile camera in AR application along with the real objects that we see through camera we can also see some additional objects that aren't actually there and we can interact with them like playing games.
## MR-Mixed Reality
MR is just like AR but we need a Headset like VR divices and we can interact with the virtual objects ditectly not through our devices, just like ***Holograms***.
## XR Terminologies
**2D & 3D Objects**
- 2D objects have only two dimensions such as length and breadth.
- 3D objects have three dimensions such as length, breadth and height.

**3D Modelling**- modeling or creating 3D objects.

**Material**- material defines optical properties of an object
- Color
- How light bounces off it etc
They make virtual objects look more realistic.

**Texture**
- Real world objects have complex patterns of color across their surface.
- A texture is an ***image that skins objects*** giving them a surface detail.

**3D Animation**- The process of giving motion to the virtual objects to bring them more to life.

**Rigging**
- The process of building a ***skeleton(bone structure) for a 3D model to make it move the way we want it to.
- Can rig any model: fielder, car, dooor etc.

**Rendering**
- Process of generating output from 2D or 3D models by means of a computer software, which can be viewed on a computer screen or a HMD.
- Considers Lighting, geometry etc and does computations.

**3D Softwares**
- Autodesk 3DS max, Blender, Maya, Cinema 4D
## Types of VR Experiences
**Degrees of Freedom** --> 3DoF VR | 6DoF VR\
**PC Requirement** --> Standalone | PC/Wired\
**Tracking** --> Inside-out | Outside-in\
**Interaction** --> Passive | Active

**3DoF** --> we can move our head in x,y and z directions in VR world.\
**6DoF** --> along with our head we can move our body in all directions in VR world.\
**Standalone** --> It doesn't require a PC for VR proccessing, just a VR headset is enough.\
**PC/Wired** --> It need a PC and our VR headset will connect to this PC with a wire/wireless, all the content that we see virtually will be processed in PC.\
**Outside-in Tracking** --> VR devices uses external sensors to detect motion and track positioning of the headset and controllers using infrared LEDs.\
**Inside-out Tracking** --> Cameras and other sensors are placed on the device itself. Advanced computer vision techniques (SLAM) are used to determine the exact position and controllers.\
**Active** --> We can interact with virtual objects.\
**Passive** --> We cannot interact with virtual objects in virtual world.
## Game Engines for VR
**Game Engine** --> An integrated development environment to enable simplified, rapid development of Games, XR experiences.It provides a suite of visual development tools in addition to reusable software components.
- Physics engine
- Rendering engine
- Animation, Sound
- AI-based components etc.

**Physics Engine** provides properties related to physics to virtual objects in VR world.
- Gravity, Froce, Velocity, Acceleration, Mass, Collisions, Friction, Elasticity, Rigidbody,Joints etc.

**Rendering Engine** is a Process of generating output from 2D or 3D models by means of a computer software, which can be viewed on a computer screen or a HMD.
- Graphics, Lightning, Shadows, Reflection, Materials, Cameras.

**Sound** --> Creating experience of echos or generating sounds from objects which are called as ***Acoustics*** and VR Audio Spatializer.Acoustics consits of Reverberation, Chorus & Echo Effects, Doppler effect etc.

**AI-based components**
- Navigation: Path finding
- ML Agents: Reinforcement Learning

## Various Game Engines
**Unity** --> A cross-platform game engine for creating interactive content (2D,3D,VR,AR).
- Games, Simulations, XR Experiences

**Unreal Engine**
- To ship visually stunning, high-quality games and experiences across PC, console, VR and mobile platforms.
- Used in variety of genres like platformers, Multiplayer games, RPGs etc.

**CRYENGINE** --> German based game engine.

**lumberyard** --> amazon company's game engine based on CRYENGINE.

**GODOT**, **APERTUS VR**, **idTECH** and many more...

**VR Platforms**
- VR for the Smartphones (android,ios)
- Standalone Headsets
- PC VR
- Web
## Web-VR
**VR on the Web**
- WebVR is an open specification for creating VR experiences in a web-browser.
- Easy to build and share quickly.
- Supports mobile, PC, Headset.

**Web-XR**
- Supports both VR and AR with better performance.

**Web-VR Frameworks**
- A-FRAME, babylon.js, three.js, FRAME VR many more..

- [make easy VR cardboard at home](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8qNmRi-gNqE)
## Types of AR
- Marker-based AR
- Markerless AR (1.Location-based AR, 2.Superimposition AR)
